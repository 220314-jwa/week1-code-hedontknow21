}
This program is starting off by creating the food class. Then it sets its mehtods up with name and type which are both strings.
Then it creates a method with 2 parameters of name and type, and creates variables using this keyword so it can choose the specific name and type of food.
The class ends with a void cook class that has an if loop asking if the name contains cooked if not add it to the beggining of the name.
Lastly in the mainthe class is instaniated and declared with values. A variable for the class is created with cook method.
The sysytem prints out "cooked potato, vegatable.
