This program creates 2 classes getFoodTypes and getFoodsByType. One is an array for the name or time frame of foods and when they should be eaten.
The other gives the specific type of food depending on the category name it falls under. Program starts of with creating an instance of the getFoodTypes and the creating a variable of the array class and giving it a value.
Then it creates an instance of getFoodsByType and declares the variable of foodsOfMyType with vaule of the other variable myType.
It then creates a for loop for the variable array string foodsOfMyType to be printed out depending on the input. The system prints out "burger".
